/**
 * Creates an object composed of keys generated from the results of running
 * each element of `collection` through `iteratee`. The corresponding value
 * of each key is the last element responsible for generating the key. The
 * iteratee function is bound to `thisArg` and invoked with three arguments:
 * (value, index|key, collection).
 *
 * If a property name is provided for `iteratee` the created `_.property`
 * style callback returns the property value of the given element.
 *
 * If a value is also provided for `thisArg` the created `_.matchesProperty`
 * style callback returns `true` for elements that have a matching property
 * value, else `false`.
 *
 * If an object is provided for `iteratee` the created `_.matches` style
 * callback returns `true` for elements that have the properties of the given
 * object, else `false`.
